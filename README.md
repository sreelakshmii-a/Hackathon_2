### Project Description
This idea revolves around creating an accessible, AI-powered website that enables blind individuals to generate a professional resume through voice commands. Many visually impaired individuals face challenges in using traditional resume-building platforms, which are heavily dependent on graphical user interfaces (GUIs). This project aims to remove these barriers and help blind individuals create resumes efficiently.

### The Problem statement
Blind individuals often face significant barriers when creating professional resumes due to the reliance on visual interfaces in traditional resume-building platforms. These platforms are not optimized for accessibility, making it difficult for users to independently input their information. As a result, many blind individuals must depend on others for assistance in building resumes, limiting their autonomy in job applications. This lack of accessible tools hinders their ability to compete equally in the job market.

### The Solution
The Voice-Assisted Resume Builder converts spoken input into a well-structured resume, offering real-time audio feedback and ensuring accessibility with screen reader support. It enables users to download, email, or apply for jobs directly through the platform, fostering independence and equal opportunity in the job market.
